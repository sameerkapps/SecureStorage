# Secure Storage Plugin for Xamarin and Windows Apps (iPhone, Android, UWP, Mac, Tizen)
The plugin can be used to **Securely store** sensitive data strings such as password, session token, credit card number etc. This plugin securely stores the strings across sessions on iOS, Android, UWP, Mac and Tizen apps. Ver 2.0.0 is now compatible with **.net standard**.

The supported platforms include:

* iOS Unified
* Android
* UWP
* MacOS (OSX)
* Tizen

It has easy to use API of key-value pairs. The pairs are saved using platform specific encryption mechanism. It has no dependencies on any packages (including Xamarin.Forms, MVVMCross.). And can be used by any Xamarin or UWP or TIzen app. It is open source.

**Note**

If your app fails to save values in iOS 10 Simulator, open the Entitlements.plist file and make sure that "Enable Keychain Access Groups" is checked. Also ensure that in Project->Options->iOS Bundle Signing, the Entitlements.plist is selected in Custom Entitlements for iPhoneSimulator platform.
This happens only in iOS 10 Simulator due to https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/77760/ios-10-keychain

## Usage ##
It provides 4 methods.

**SetValue** - Stores the key and value.

``` 
CrossSecureStorage.Current.SetValue(“SessionToken”, “1234567890”);
```

**GetValue** - Returns the value for the given key. If not found, returns default value.

``` 
var sessionToken = CrossSecureStorage.Current.GetValue (“SessionToken”);
``` 


**DeleteKey** - Deletes the given key and corresponding value from the storage.

``` 
CrossSecureStorage.Current.DeleteKey(“SessionToken”);
``` 

**HasKey** - Checks if the given key exists in the storage.

```
var exists = CrossSecureStorage.Current.HasKey (“SessionToken”);
``` 

NOTE: In Android Apps,  by default the password for storage is the hardware serial number. So it is unique per device. Should you want to choose your password, it can be done as follows

```
SecureStorageImplementation.StoragePassword = "Your Password";
```
Make sure that you obfuscate the app so the password is not reverse engineered.

In the UWP Apps, the data is stored in the password vault. It has a built in limit of 10 values per app.

# Changes in 2.0.0
* Abstraction Layer - Now compatible with .net standard
* iOS - No special changes
* Android - Hardware serial number is the default password
* UWP - New platform in 2.0.0. It has the following limitations.
    
        UWP Password vault has limitation of 10 values per app
        The value cannot be set as null or empty string. (Delete the key instead.)

* Mac - New platform in 2.0.0
* Tizen - New platform in 2.0.0
* Windows Phone 8.X - Retired. If you want to use it, it is there in 1.2.2 


The sample apps shows how to use it in Xamarin and in Tizen Apps.
